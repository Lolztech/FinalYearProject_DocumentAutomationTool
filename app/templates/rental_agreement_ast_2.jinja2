    C3.2 The Tenant must not use the Property for the purposes of a business, trade or profession except with the prior written consent of the Landlord, which must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In particular, it will not be unreasonable for the Landlord to withhold consent if there is a reasonable likelihood that the use proposed would:

        (a) give rise to a tenancy to which Part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (business tenancies) applies; or  
        (b) cause a nuisance to the occupiers of neighbouring properties or significantly increase wear and tear to the Property.

    {% if business_use_allowed == 'yes' %}

    {% if pets_allowed == 'yes' %}
    C3.7 The Landlord has pre-approved the Tenant’s request to keep pets at the Property, on the basis that the Tenant is a responsible pet owner and the animals are suitable for the premises. Consent has been granted under the conditions of clause C3.6.
    {% else %}
    C3.7 A Landlord must not unreasonably withhold or delay a written request from a Tenant without considering the request on its own merits. The Landlord should accept such a request where they are satisfied the Tenant is a responsible pet owner and the pet is of a kind that is suitable in relation to the nature of the premises at which it will be kept. Consent is deemed to be granted unless the written request is turned down by a Landlord with good reason in writing within 28 days of receiving the request.

    A Landlord is prohibited from charging a fee to a Tenant who wishes to keep pets or other animals at the Property. Permission may be given on the condition that the Tenant pays an additional reasonable amount towards the deposit, but the deposit must not breach the deposit cap requirements under the Tenant Fees Act 2019 (see clause B10).

        (c) the Tenant agrees to return the Property to its original condition at the end of the Tenancy, unless otherwise agreed.

    Alterations of a structural nature or involving electrical/plumbing work still require the Landlord’s prior written consent.
    {% else %}
    The Tenant must not make any addition or alteration to the Property or redecorate the Property (or any part of it) without the Landlord’s prior written consent, which must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
    {% endif %}
